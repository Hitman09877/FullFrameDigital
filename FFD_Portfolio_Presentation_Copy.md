## Page 1: Who We Are

**Headline:**
Small team. Big vision. No fluff.

**Body:**
We're Full Frame Digital, a two-person creative agency based in Sydney. We partner with businesses who are done blending in and ready to be seen.

We don't do cookie-cutter. Every brand has a story worth telling properly, and we've built a studio around making that happen, from the first strategy session to the final frame.

**Tagline line (bottom of slide):**
Sydney-born. Creatively driven. Results-obsessed.

## Page 2: What We Do

**Headline:**
We make brands impossible to scroll past.

**Body:**
We create the content, build the platforms, and shape the strategy that turns attention into action.

- **Capture it** / Photography & videography that stops the scroll
- **Design it** / Graphics and visuals that feel like your brand, not a template
- **Build it** / Websites that look sharp and actually convert
- **Plan it** / Social strategy and consulting that connects the dots

**Tagline line (bottom of slide):**
Strategy to execution. One team. One vision.

## Page 3: Our Approach

**Headline:**
We don't just make things look good. We make them work.

**Body:**
Every project starts with understanding what you actually need, not what looks cool in a pitch deck.

**1. Listen**
We dig into your brand, your audience, and your goals. No assumptions.

**2. Create**
We produce content with intent. Every shot, every pixel, every word earns its place.

**3. Deliver**
On time, on brand, on brief. Then we review what worked and sharpen the next round.

**Tagline line (bottom of slide):**
Less guesswork. More results.
