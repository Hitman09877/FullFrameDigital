# Full Frame Digital - Pricing Strategy

## Pricing Philosophy

Full Frame Digital sits at the **mid-range** of the Sydney creative agency market. Fair pricing that reflects quality work, without racing to the bottom or pricing out small-to-medium clients. The goal is to build long-term retainer relationships at $3-5k/mo, not chase one-off gigs.

**Core principle:** Make retainers the obvious choice. One-off rates should always feel slightly more expensive than the equivalent retainer value, nudging clients toward recurring engagements.

## Rate Card (All rates AUD, inc GST)

### One-Off / Ad Hoc Rates

| Service | Hourly | Half Day (4hrs) | Full Day (8hrs) |

**Half day** = 4 hours with a 10% discount applied.
**Full day** = 8 hours with a 10% discount applied.

### How Rates Are Calculated

Take-home rate / 0.70 (30% tax provision) x 1.10 (10% GST) = invoice rate.

### Take-Home Per Booking (After GST + 30% Tax Provision)

|---------|--------|----------|----------|
| Web Design & Dev | $180 | $648 | $1,296 |

## Retainer Packages (Real Estate Clients)

Retainers are the primary revenue model. These tiers are designed to move clients from basic content needs into full-service marketing partnerships.

### Tier 1 - "Listings" (~$1,500-2,000/mo)

- 2x property photo shoots per month
- 1x short-form video per listing
- Basic editing, 48hr turnaround, digital delivery
- **Target:** Individual agents who need consistent property content
- **Path to upsell:** Once they see results from quality listing content, introduce personal branding and social strategy

### Tier 2 - "Brand Builder" (~$3,000-4,000/mo) **[Recommended]**

- 4x property shoots per month
- 2x short-form videos per month
- 1x agent personal brand content session per month
- Social media content calendar + caption writing
- Graphic design for social posts
- Monthly strategy call
- **Target:** Agents and small agencies building a brand
- **Why this is the sweet spot:** It's the ideal balance of value delivered vs. revenue. Hits the $3-5k/mo target range and covers both property and personal brand content

### Tier 3 - "Full Frame" (~$5,000-7,000/mo)

- Unlimited property shoots (reasonable scope), including drone/aerial
- Full social media management + reporting
- Quarterly brand strategy review
- Website maintenance
- Priority scheduling, same-day turnaround available
- **Target:** Agencies and top-producing agents who want market dominance
- **Positioning:** The premium, white-glove tier for clients who want to hand off their entire marketing operation

## Pricing Levers and Tactics

### Incentivise Retainers Over One-Offs

- One-off rate card prices sit 15-20% above the effective per-hour retainer rate
- Always present retainer pricing alongside one-off quotes so the comparison is visible
- Frame retainers as "guaranteed availability" and "priority scheduling" to add perceived value beyond the discount

### Commitment Discounts

- **6-month retainer commitment:** 10% discount
- **12-month retainer commitment:** 15% discount
- Lock in revenue predictability while rewarding loyalty

### Onboarding Fee

- **$500-1,000 one-time setup fee** for new retainer clients
- Covers: brand audit, style guide alignment, content workflow setup, platform access
- Positions the relationship as a professional engagement, not just a vendor arrangement
- Can be waived strategically for high-value prospects or referrals

### Upsell and Add-On Opportunities

- **Drone/aerial photography:** Add-on for Tier 1 and Tier 2 clients ($200-400 per session)
- **Rush delivery (same-day/next-day):** 25% surcharge on one-off bookings
- **Additional social platforms:** $500-800/mo per additional platform managed
- **Quarterly brand shoots:** $1,200-1,800 per session (headshots, lifestyle, team photos)
- **Website builds:** Project-based pricing, $3,000-8,000 depending on scope

## Quoting and Negotiation Guidelines

### When Quoting

1. Always lead with retainer options before presenting one-off rates
2. Anchor on Tier 2 ("Brand Builder") as the recommended starting point
3. Use the rate card for one-offs but round to clean numbers on proposals (e.g. $1,700 not $1,699)
4. Include a clear scope of work so there's no ambiguity about deliverables

### Negotiation Boundaries

- **Never discount below take-home rates.** The tax provision and GST are non-negotiable costs
- **Minimum viable engagement:** $1,500/mo for retainers. Below that, the admin overhead doesn't justify the engagement
- **Trade discounts for case studies, not for nothing.** If a high-profile client wants a lower rate, exchange it for permission to use their brand, results, and testimonials in FFD marketing
- **Scope reduction over rate reduction.** If a client can't afford the full package, remove deliverables rather than cutting your rate

### Strategic Discounting

- Offer discounted or free work **only** for high-profile real estate clients who can serve as flagship case studies
- Cap strategic discounting at 1-2 clients at any time
- Always have a written agreement on what you get in return (testimonials, social proof, referrals, brand usage rights)

## Revenue Targets

### 12-Month Goal: $20k+/mo

**Scenario to hit $20k/mo:**

| Source | Count | Avg Monthly | Monthly Total |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Tier 2 retainers | 3 | $3,500 | $10,500 |
| Tier 1 retainers | 3 | $1,750 | $5,250 |
| Tier 3 retainers | 1 | $6,000 | $6,000 |
| One-off projects | 2-3 | $800 | $2,000 |
| **Total** | | | **$23,750** |

This gives a buffer above $20k and is achievable with 7 retainer clients plus a few ad hoc bookings per month.

### Key Metrics to Track

- **Average revenue per client per month**
- **Retainer vs. one-off revenue split** (target: 80%+ from retainers)
- **Client retention rate** (target: 90%+ quarter-over-quarter)
- **Upsell rate** (percentage of Tier 1 clients moving to Tier 2+)
- **Effective hourly rate** across all work (ensure it stays above take-home minimums)

## Positioning Against Competitors

### vs. Cheaper Freelancers / Budget Agencies
- Don't compete on price. Compete on quality, reliability, and full-service capability
- Emphasise the cost of bad content (poor listings sit longer, weak branding loses leads)
- Show portfolio work that demonstrates the gap in quality

### vs. Larger Agencies
- More affordable than big agencies without sacrificing quality
- Personalised service, direct access to the people doing the work (no account managers as middlemen)
- Faster turnaround and more flexible scheduling

### vs. In-House Marketing Teams
- More cost-effective than a full-time hire (no salary, super, leave, equipment costs)
- Broader skill set across photo, video, design, and strategy
- Fresh outside perspective vs. internal echo chamber

## Review Cadence

- Review pricing quarterly against market rates, workload, and profitability
- Adjust retainer tiers annually based on what clients actually use and value
- Track which add-ons get the most uptake and consider bundling them into tiers
- If consistently booked out 4+ weeks ahead, it's time to raise rates
